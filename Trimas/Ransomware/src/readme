How to run:

For the ransomware script:

			$bash ransomware.sh <number of files> <name of the f to save them>

If you want to check the functionality of the logger file from the previous assignment:
			$make all
			$make run

To run the operations of the acmonitor:
			$./acmonitor -i <filename>	, Prints table of users that modified the file given and the number of modifications.(Assignment 4)
			$./acmonitor -v <num_of_files>  , Prints the total number of files created in the last 20 minutes.
			$./acmonitor -e			, Prints all the files that were encrypted by the ransomware.
			$./acmonitor -m			, Prints malicious users.
			$./acmoniotr -h			, Help message.

To clear unwanted files run:
			$make clean
			
For the assignment No.5 I decided to make my life easier than the last one and I used data structures. A simple stack did the job to keep all the important information
for the new functions of the acmonitor.

For -v operation, I stack all the log entries that have create flag on, and after breaking down the date and the time of the files, I enumerate them to check if they are above the time limit the user specifies.

For the -e file, I break down the suffix of each log entry file name and check if it is .encrypt, and after I check that the file is not in the stack already I add it.
Finally I print the name of the files that are saved in the stack and have .encrypt suffix.
