How to run:

$make clean
$make all
$make run

Until this point, 10 files will be created with various accesses enabled or disabled. 
To run the operations of the second task:

./acmonitor -m

or

./acmonitor -i <filename>

In the folder there is a log file already created but by running make clean you can remove it.

Whenever a user creates a file, the log file keeps track of it and saves it in file_logging.log, with access 0. If the user wants only to open and read a file the access is 1 and for writting the access is 2. If the user has no access to a file, the log file also keeps track of that. By running the acmonitor program, you can keep track of the malicious user and find the number of accesses and modification a user has make to a certain file.
