[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

A journey in Systems and Information's Security under the HPY414, Electrical and Computer Engineering@Technical University of Crete .

  - crypto-lib      [Assignment 1, Simple ciphers from scratch in C].
  - encryptor       [Assignment 2, OpenSSL and AES in C].
  - encrypt-lib     [Assignment 3, Simple RSA encryption/decryption tool in C].
  - logix           [Assignment 4-5, Simple Log Monitoring tool in C, Simple ransomware in Bash].
  - netmon          [Assignment 6, Simple Network Sniffer using Libpcap in C].
  - adblock         [Assignment 7, Simple Adblocker using iptables in Bash].

## Important to know!
### General guidelines:
  - Projects were builted and tested under Unbuntu Linux 19.10(x86_64) - 20.04(x86_64) via *gcc* compiler.
  - Each directory represents an assignment, if not sure about how to run check the *Makefile* of each project.
  - Most of them are not suitable to even run under Windows distros [trying that in strictly discouraged].
  - Every source code in this will remain public and under common MIT Licence, but bare in mind that Universities do use plagiarism detectors which check the flow of your code [just change some stuff..].
  - The code published is not secure to use under real-life situations since it has been built for University purposes [my MEng in Computer Engineering at TUC] and therefore is unsuitable to protect or breach a real system [unless you deal with dummies or scripties].
  - For each and every task, extended theory and its comprehension is mandatory if wishing to alter this.
  - If quetions/issues arrise feel free to comment them or mail me..


### You must:
-   Have some sort of understanding about:
    - Networking (TCP, UDP, Ethernet headers) and its implementation in C (sockets, structs).
    - Monolithic Operating Systems (for instance Linux).
    - Algorithms and Basic Cryptography.
-   Be capable of implementing "advanced" C concepts [such as system-calls, pointers etc.].
-   Be brave enough.
    
### You can also:
  - Fork and let me help if you wish to.
  - Extend the functionality of those freely under your own branch.
  - Argue about techniques or code provided [in a civilized manner].
  - Attempt to implement tasks in languages other than C [I believe Python is a good rival here].

### Hint:
  - Code is extensively (or even excessively) commented therefore attempt to resolve any issues concerning theory by checking comments.
